                    <h1>$Whoami</h1>
                    <p>I am 17 years old attending high school in Tunisia. sometimes known as TNX. for the past couple of years, i have been learning about information security and programming. When i am not playing video games or on the computer i am on the road from hackerspace to a local tech event and back again, i like to hangout with friends and participating in CTF contests(where i finally started to feel like i fit in) sharing my love of breaking things and building them again.
                        I recently started a blog about InfoSec where I write about topics which interest Cyber Security Enthusiasts , its called s3curi7y.tn .
                        I also have been working on my Linux system , AWS and Azure skills .</p>
